I want to remove my android device's wifi capability. My thought is to get the kernel source, disable or remove the wifi network interface, recompile the kernel, and flash it onto my device. Give me detailed instructions for how to do each of these things

GPT-4o mini:
Disabling the Wi-Fi capability of an Android device by modifying the kernel is a complex process that requires a good understanding of Linux kernel development, Android architecture, and the specific hardware of your device. Below are detailed instructions, but please proceed with caution, as this process can potentially brick your device or void its warranty.

### Prerequisites

1. **Rooted Device**: Ensure your device is rooted. You will need root access to flash a custom kernel.
2. **Backup**: Backup all important data on your device. This process can lead to data loss.
3. **Development Environment**: Set up a Linux environment (Ubuntu is commonly used) with the necessary tools installed:
   - `git`
   - `gcc`
   - `make`
   - `android-tools`
   - `repo` (for managing Android source code)

### Step 1: Obtain the Kernel Source Code

1. **Find the Kernel Source**: Check the manufacturer's website or the device's XDA Developers forum for the kernel source code. It is usually provided as a tarball or a git repository.
   
2. **Download the Kernel Source**:
   ```bash
   git clone <kernel_source_repository_url>
   cd <kernel_source_directory>
   ```

### Step 2: Modify the Kernel

1. **Locate the Wi-Fi Driver**: The Wi-Fi driver is usually located in the `drivers/net/wireless` directory. The exact path may vary based on the chipset used in your device (e.g., `drivers/net/wireless/ath`, `drivers/net/wireless/broadcom`, etc.).

2. **Disable the Wi-Fi Driver**:
   - You can either comment out the code that registers the Wi-Fi driver or remove the driver files entirely. 
   - For example, if you find a file like `wifi_driver.c`, you can comment out the registration function:
     ```c
     // module_init(wifi_driver_init);
     ```

3. **Modify the Configuration**: You may also need to modify the kernel configuration file (usually `.config` in the kernel source root) to exclude the Wi-Fi driver from being built. Look for lines related to the Wi-Fi driver and disable them.

### Step 3: Compile the Kernel

1. **Set Up the Build Environment**:
   ```bash
   export ARCH=arm  # or arm64, depending on your device
   export CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-androideabi-  # or aarch64-linux-gnu- for arm64
   ```

2. **Configure the Kernel**:
   ```bash
   make <device_defconfig>  # Replace with your device's defconfig
   ```

3. **Build the Kernel**:
   ```bash
   make -j$(nproc)
   ```

### Step 4: Flash the Kernel

1. **Prepare the Boot Image**: After building, you will have a `zImage` or `Image.gz` file in the `arch/arm/boot/` or `arch/arm64/boot/` directory.

2. **Create a Boot Image**: You may need to create a boot image that includes the kernel and the ramdisk. Use `mkbootimg` or similar tools to create a boot image.

3. **Flash the Kernel**:
   - Boot your device into recovery mode (usually by holding Volume Up + Power).
   - Use `fastboot` to flash the new kernel:
     ```bash
     fastboot flash boot <path_to_your_boot_image>
     ```

### Step 5: Reboot and Test

1. **Reboot the Device**:
   ```bash
   fastboot reboot
   ```

2. **Test**: Once the device boots up, check if the Wi-Fi capability is disabled. You can do this by going to the Wi-Fi settings.

### Important Notes

- **Bricking Risk**: There is a risk of bricking your device. Ensure you have a way to recover (like a stock firmware image).
- **Warranty**: Modifying the kernel will likely void your warranty.
- **Device-Specific Instructions**: The steps may vary based on the device model and manufacturer. Always refer to device-specific forums for guidance.

### Conclusion

This process is not for the faint of heart and requires technical expertise. If you're not comfortable with these steps, consider alternative methods to disable Wi-Fi, such as using apps that restrict network access or modifying system settings.

Can you elaborate on how to figure out which driver is used by my device for wifi?

GPT-4o mini:
Identifying the Wi-Fi driver used by your Android device involves several steps. Here’s a detailed guide on how to do this:

### Step 1: Check Device Specifications

1. **Manufacturer Documentation**: Start by checking the official specifications of your device on the manufacturer's website. Look for details about the Wi-Fi chipset. Common manufacturers include Qualcomm, Broadcom, MediaTek, and Realtek.

2. **XDA Developers Forum**: Search for your device on the XDA Developers forum. Often, users will discuss the hardware specifications, including the Wi-Fi chipset.

### Step 2: Use Android Apps

1. **Install a Hardware Info App**: Download an app like **CPU-Z**, **AIDA64**, or **Device Info HW** from the Google Play Store. These apps provide detailed information about your device's hardware.

2. **Check Wi-Fi Information**: Open the app and navigate to the Wi-Fi section. Look for the chipset or driver information. It may list the manufacturer and model of the Wi-Fi chip.

### Step 3: Use Terminal Commands

If you have a terminal emulator app installed on your device or if you can connect via ADB (Android Debug Bridge), you can use commands to gather information about the Wi-Fi driver.

1. **Connect via ADB**:
   - Enable USB debugging on your device (found in Developer Options).
   - Connect your device to your computer via USB.
   - Open a terminal or command prompt on your computer and type:
     ```bash
     adb devices
     ```
   - Ensure your device is listed.

2. **Get Wi-Fi Driver Information**:
   - Run the following command to get detailed information about the Wi-Fi interface:
     ```bash
     adb shell
     ```
   - Then, within the shell, type:
     ```bash
     iwconfig
     ```
   - This command will show you the wireless interfaces and their associated drivers.

3. **Check Kernel Modules**:
   - You can also check the loaded kernel modules to find the Wi-Fi driver:
     ```bash
     lsmod
     ```
   - Look for entries that might indicate Wi-Fi drivers, such as `ath9k`, `b43`, `brcmfmac`, etc.

### Step 4: Check System Logs

1. **Logcat**: You can use `logcat` to check for driver-related messages during boot or when the Wi-Fi is activated.
   - Run:
     ```bash
     adb logcat
     ```
   - Look for lines that mention Wi-Fi or the specific driver name.

### Step 5: Review Kernel Source Code

If you have access to the kernel source code for your device, you can look for the Wi-Fi driver in the following directories:

1. **Navigate to the Driver Directory**:
   - Common paths include:
     - `drivers/net/wireless/`
     - `drivers/net/wireless/<vendor>/`
   - Look for files that correspond to the chipset you identified earlier.

2. **Check the Makefile**: In the driver directory, there may be a `Makefile` that lists the drivers being compiled. This can give you clues about which drivers are included.

### Step 6: Use Online Resources

1. **Linux Wireless**: The [Linux Wireless](https://wireless.wiki.kernel.org/en/users/Drivers) website provides a list of wireless drivers and their supported chipsets. You can cross-reference the chipset you found with the drivers listed there.

2. **Device-Specific Resources**: Search for your device model along with "Wi-Fi driver" on forums or GitHub repositories. Often, developers will have documented the drivers used for specific devices.

### Conclusion

By following these steps, you should be able to identify the Wi-Fi driver used by your Android device. Once you have this information, you can proceed with modifying the kernel or exploring other options to disable Wi-Fi functionality. If you encounter difficulties, consider seeking help from community forums specific to your device.
